# SimpleColourPicker
Simple iOS colour picker. Written in swift.

Note : this is my first git project so there will be mistakes. Be nice :).

Wrote a simple, slider based colour picker for iOS.
Supports RGB, CMYK & gray scale.

Built with XCode 9.4.1.
Should just compile without any issue.
Sample project shows how it works.

ViewController.swift has the usage.
